    #
    # You can also pass the class instead of an instance (if you don't have one handy).
    #
    #   can? :create, Project
    #
    # Nested resources can be passed through a hash, this way conditions which are
    # dependent upon the association will work when using a class.
    #
    #   can? :create, @category => Project
    #
    # You can also pass multiple objects to check. You only need to pass a hash
    # following the pattern { :any => [many subjects] }. The behaviour is check if
    # there is a permission on any of the given objects.
    #
    #   can? :create, {:any => [Project, Rule]}
    #
    #
    # Any additional arguments will be passed into the "can" block definition. This
    # can be used to pass more information about the user's request for example.

    # you're setting the permission for, the second one is the class of object you're setting it on.
    #
    #   can :update, Article
    #
    # You can pass an array for either of these parameters to match any one.
    # Here the user has the ability to update or destroy both articles and comments.
    #
    #   can [:update, :destroy], [Article, Comment]
    #
    # You can pass :all to match any object and :manage to match any action. Here are some examples.
    #
    #   can :manage, :all
    #   can :update, :all
    #   can :manage, Project
    #
    # You can pass a hash of conditions as the third argument. Here the user can only see active projects which he owns.
    #
    #   can :read, Project, :active => true, :user_id => user.id
    #
    # See ActiveRecordAdditions#accessible_by for how to use this in database queries. These conditions
    # are also used for initial attributes when building a record in ControllerAdditions#load_resource.
    #
    # If the conditions hash does not give you enough control over defining abilities, you can use a block
    # along with any Ruby code you want.
    #
    #   can :update, Project do |project|
    #     project.groups.include?(user.group)
    #   end
    #
    # If the block returns true then the user has that :update ability for that project, otherwise he
    # will be denied access. The downside to using a block is that it cannot be used to generate
    # conditions for database queries.
    #
    # You can pass custom objects into this "can" method, this is usually done with a symbol
    # and is useful if a class isn't available to define permissions on.
    #
    #   can :read, :stats
    #   can? :read, :stats # => true

    # IMPORTANT: Neither a hash of conditions nor a block will be used when checking permission on a class.

    #
    # If you pass no arguments to +can+, the action, class, and object will be passed to the block and the
    # block will always be executed. This allows you to override the full behavior if the permissions are
    # defined in an external source such as the database.
