CanCanCan is an authorization library for Ruby >= 2.2.0 and Ruby on Rails >= 4.2 which restricts what resources a given user is allowed to access. 

All permissions are defined in a single location (the `Ability` class) and not duplicated across controllers, views, and database queries.


## Installation

Add this to your Gemfile: 

    gem 'cancancan', '~> 2.0'
    
and run the `bundle install` command.

For Rails < 4.2 use:

    gem 'cancancan', '~> 1.10'
   
## Getting Started

CanCanCan expects a `current_user` method to exist in the controller. 
First, set up some authentication (such as [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) or [Authlogic](https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic)). 
See [Changing Defaults](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/wiki/changing-defaults) if you need a different behavior.

### 1. Define Abilities

User permissions are defined in an `Ability` class.

    rails g cancan:ability

See [Defining Abilities](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/wiki/defining-abilities) for details.


### 2. Check Abilities & Authorization

The current user's permissions can then be checked using the `can?` and `cannot?` methods in views and controllers.

```erb
<% if can? :update, @article %>
  <%= link_to "Edit", edit_article_path(@article) %>
<% end %>
```

See [Checking Abilities](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/wiki/checking-abilities) for more information

The `authorize!` method in the controller will raise an exception if the user is not able to perform the given action.

```ruby
def show
  @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  authorize! :read, @article
end
```

Setting this for every action can be tedious, therefore the `load_and_authorize_resource` method is provided to 
automatically authorize all actions in a RESTful style resource controller. 
It will use a before action to load the resource into an instance variable and authorize it for every action.

```ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  load_and_authorize_resource

  def show
    # @article is already loaded and authorized
  end
end
```

See [Authorizing Controller Actions](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/wiki/authorizing-controller-actions) for more information.


#### Strong Parameters

You have to sanitize inputs before saving the record, in actions such as `:create` and `:update`.

For the `:update` action, CanCanCan will load and authorize the resource but *not* change it automatically, so the typical usage would be something like:

```ruby
def update
  if @article.update_attributes(update_params)
    # hurray
  else
    render :edit
  end
end
...

def update_params
  params.require(:article).permit(:body)
end
```

For the `:create` action, CanCanCan will try to initialize a new instance with sanitized input by seeing if your 
controller will respond to the following methods (in order):

1. `create_params`
2. `<model_name>_params` such as `article_params` (this is the default convention in rails for naming your param method)
3. `resource_params` (a generically named method you could specify in each controller)

Additionally, `load_and_authorize_resource` can now take a `param_method` option to specify a custom method in the controller to run to sanitize input.

You can associate the `param_method` option with a symbol corresponding to the name of a method that will get called:

```ruby
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  load_and_authorize_resource param_method: :my_sanitizer

  def create
    if @article.save
      # hurray
    else
      render :new
    end
  end

  private

  def my_sanitizer
    params.require(:article).permit(:name)
  end
end
```

You can also use a string that will be evaluated in the context of the controller using `instance_eval` and needs to contain valid Ruby code. 

    load_and_authorize_resource param_method: 'permitted_params.article'

Finally, it's possible to associate `param_method` with a Proc object which will be called with the controller as the only argument:

    load_and_authorize_resource param_method: Proc.new { |c| c.params.require(:article).permit(:name) }

See [Strong Parameters](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/wiki/Strong-Parameters) for more information.

### 3. Handle Unauthorized Access

If the user authorization fails, a `CanCan::AccessDenied` exception will be raised. 
You can catch this and modify its behavior in the `ApplicationController`.

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  rescue_from CanCan::AccessDenied do |exception|
      respond_to do |format|
        format.json { head :forbidden, content_type: 'text/html' }
        format.html { redirect_to main_app.root_url, notice: exception.message }
        format.js   { head :forbidden, content_type: 'text/html' }
      end
    end
end
```

See [Exception Handling](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/wiki/exception-handling) for more information.


### 4. Lock It Down

If you want to ensure authorization happens on every action in your application, add `check_authorization` to your `ApplicationController`.

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  check_authorization
end
```

This will raise an exception if authorization is not performed in an action. 
If you want to skip this, add `skip_authorization_check` to a controller subclass. 
See [Ensure Authorization](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/wiki/Ensure-Authorization) for more information.

## Version 2.0

Version 2.0 drops support for Mongoid and Sequel. 

Please use `gem 'cancancan', '~> 1.10'` for them.

If you are interested in supporting them, contribute to the sibling gems `cancancan-sequel` and `cancancan-mongoid`.

Version 2.0 drops also support for Rails < 4.2 and ruby < 2.2 so, again, use the version 1 of the Gem for these.

## Mission

This repo is a continuation of the dead [CanCan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan) project. 
Our mission is to keep CanCan alive and moving forward, with maintenance fixes and new features. 
Pull Requests are welcome!

Any help is greatly appreciated, feel free to submit pull-requests or open issues.


## Questions?

If you have any question or doubt regarding CanCanCan which you cannot find the solution to in the 
[documentation](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/wiki) or our 
[mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/cancancan), please 
[open a question on Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=cancancan) with tag

## Bugs?

If you find a bug please add an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/issues) or fork the project and send a pull request.


## Development

CanCanCan uses [appraisals](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal) to test the code base against multiple versions 
of Rails, as well as the different model adapters.

When first developing, you may need to run `bundle install` and then `appraisal install`, to install the different sets.

You can then run all appraisal files (like CI does), with `appraisal rake` or just run a specific set `appraisal activerecord_5.0 rake`.
