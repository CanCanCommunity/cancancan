* Adding clear_aliased_actions to Ability which removes previously defined actions including defaults - see issue #20.

* Append aliased actions (don't overwrite them) - see issue #20.

* Adding custom message argument to unauthorized! method (tjwallace) - see issue #18.

* {see the full list of changes}[https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/compare/1.0.1...1.0.2].


## 1.0.1 (Dec 14, 2009)

* Adding :class option to load_resource so one can customize which class to use for the model - see issue #17.

* Don't fetch parent of nested resource if *_id parameter is missing so it works with shallow nested routes - see issue #14.

* {see the full list of changes}[https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/compare/1.0.0...1.0.1].


## 1.0.0 (Dec 13, 2009)

* Don't set resource instance variable if it has been set already - see issue #13.

* Allowing :nested option to accept an array for deep nesting.

* Adding :nested option to load resource method - see issue #10.

* Pass :only and :except options to before filters for load/authorize resource methods.

* Adding :collection and :new options to load_resource method so we can specify behavior of additional actions if needed.

* BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: turning load and authorize resource methods into class methods which set up the before filter so they can accept additional arguments.

* {see the full list of changes}[https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/compare/0.2.1...1.0.0].
