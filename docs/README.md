# CanCanCan - Developer guide

This is the official guide to CanCanCan.

It will advance chapter by chapter and go more and more into details, advanced usages, and special cases.

We will start by introducing basic concepts and features, and then dig deeper into configurations and implementation details in later chapters.

You can skip the [Introduction](./introduction.md) where there's just some history and blablabla and go directly to [Installation](./installation) to start fast :rocket:.
