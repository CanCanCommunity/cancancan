# Defining Abilities: Best Practices

## Use hash conditions as much as possible

### Although scopes are fine for fetching, they pose a problem when authorizing a discrete action.

For example, this declaration in Ability:

```ruby
can :read, Article, Article.is_published
```

causes this `CanCan::Error`:

```
The can? and cannot? call cannot be used with a raw sql 'can' definition.
The checking code cannot be determined for :read #<Article ..>.
```

A better way to define the same is:

```ruby
can :read, Article, is_published: true
```

### Hash conditions are DRYer.

By using hashes instead of blocks for all actions, you won't have to worry about translating blocks used for member controller actions (`:create`, `:destroy`, `:update`) to equivalent blocks for collection actions (`:index`, `:show`)â€”which require hashes anyway!

### Hash conditions are OR'd in SQL, giving you maximum flexibilty.
  
Every time you define an ability with `can`, each `can` chains together with OR in the final SQL query for that model.

So if, in addition to the `is_published` condition above, we want to allow authors to see their drafts:

```ruby
can :read, Article, author_id: @user.id, is_published: false
```

Then the final SQL would be:

```sql
SELECT `articles`.*
FROM   `articles`
WHERE  `articles`.`is_published` = 1
OR ( `articles`.`author_id` = 97 AND `articles`.`is_published` = 0 )
```

### For complex object graphs, hash conditions accommodate `joins` easily.

See [Hash of Conditions Chapter](./hash_of_conditions.md).

### Give permissions, don't take them away

As suggested in this [topic on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/6ytka8/refactoring_cancancan_abilities_brewing_bits/) you should, when possible, give increasing permissions to your users.

CanCanCan increases permissions: it starts by giving no permissions to nobody and then increases those permissions depending on the user. 

A properly written `ability.rb` looks like that:

```ruby
class Ability
  include CanCan::Ability

  def initialize(user)
    can :read, Post  # start by defining rules for all users, also not logged ones
    return unless user.present?
    can :manage, Post, user_id: user.id # if the user is logged in can manage it's own posts
    can :create, Comment # logged in users can also create comments
    return unless user.manager? # if the user is a manager we give additional permissions
    can :manage, Comment # like managing all comments in the website
    return unless user.admin?
    can :manage, :all # finally we give all remaining permissions only to the admins
  end
end
```

following this good practice will help you to keep your permissions clean and more readable. 

The risk of giving wrong permissions to the wrong users is also decreased.
