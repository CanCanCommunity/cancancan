# Defining Abilities

The `Ability` class is where all user permissions are defined. An example class looks like this.

```ruby
class Ability
  include CanCan::Ability

  def initialize(user)
    can :read, :all # permissions for every user, even if not logged in    
    if user.present?  # additional permissions for logged in users (they can manage their posts)
      can :manage, Post, user_id: user.id 
      if user.admin?  # additional permissions for administrators
        can :manage, :all
      end
    end
  end
end
```

The `current_user` model is passed into the initialize method, so the permissions can be modified based on any user attributes. CanCanCan makes no assumption about how roles are handled in your application. See [[Role Based Authorization]] for an example.

## The `can` Method

The `can` method is used to define permissions and requires two arguments. The first one is the action you're setting the permission for, the second one is the class of object you're setting it on.

```ruby
can :update, Article
```

You can pass `:manage` to represent any action and `:all` to represent any object.

```ruby
can :manage, Article  # user can perform any action on the article
can :read, :all       # user can read any object
can :manage, :all     # user can perform any action on any object
```

Common actions are `:read`, `:create`, `:update` and `:destroy` but it can be anything. See [[Action Aliases]] and [[Custom Actions]] for more information on actions.

You can pass an array for either of these parameters to match any one. For example, here the user will have the ability to update or destroy both articles and comments.

```ruby
can [:update, :destroy], [Article, Comment]
```


**Important notice about :manage**. As you read above it represents ANY action on the object. So if you have something like:

```ruby
can :manage, User
can :invite, User
```

you can get rid of the second line and the `:invite` permissions, because `:manage` represents **any** action on object and `:manage` is not just `:create`, `:read`, `:update`, `:destroy` on object.

If you want only CRUD actions on object, you should create custom action that called `:crud` for example, and use it instead of `:manage`:

```ruby
def initialize(user)
  alias_action :create, :read, :update, :destroy, to: :crud
  if user.present?
    can :crud, User
    can :invite, User
  end
end
```

## Hash of Conditions

A hash of conditions can be passed to further restrict which records this permission applies to. Here the user will only have permission to read active projects which they own.

```ruby
can :read, Project, active: true, user_id: user.id
```

It is important to only use database columns for these conditions so it can be reused for [[Fetching Records]].

You can use nested hashes to define conditions on associations. Here the project can only be read if the category it belongs to is visible.

```ruby
can :read, Project, category: { visible: true }
```

The above will issue a query that performs an `LEFT JOIN` to query conditions on associated records. 
The example below will use a scope that returns all Photos that do not belong to a group.

```ruby 
class Photo
  has_and_belongs_to_many :groups
  scope :unowned, -> { left_joins(:groups).where(groups: { id: nil }) }
end

class Group
  has_and_belongs_to_many :photos
end

class Ability
  def initialize(user)    
    can :read, Photo, Photo.unowned do |photo|
      photo.groups.empty?
    end
  end
end
```

An array or range can be passed to match multiple values. Here the user can only read projects of priority 1 through 3.

```ruby
can :read, Project, priority: 1..3
```

Almost anything that you can pass to a hash of conditions in Active Record will work here. The only exception is working with model ids. You can't pass in the model objects directly, you must pass in the ids.

```ruby
can :manage, Project, group: { id: user.group_ids }
```

If you have a complex case which cannot be done through a hash of conditions, see [Defining Abilities with Blocks](./Defining-Abilities-with-Blocks.md).

## Traverse associations

All associations can be traversed when defining a rule.

```ruby
class User
  belongs_to :account
end

class Account
  has_one :user  
  has_many :services
end

class Service
  belongs_to :account
  has_many :parts
end

class Part 
  belongs_to :service
end

# Ability
can :manage, Part, service: { account: { user: { id: user.id } } }
```

## Combining Abilities

It is possible to define multiple abilities for the same resource. Here the user will be able to read projects which are released OR available for preview.

```ruby
can :read, Project, released: true
can :read, Project, preview: true
```

The `cannot` method takes the same arguments as `can` and defines which actions the user is unable to perform. This is normally done after a more generic `can` call.

```ruby
can :manage, Project
cannot :destroy, Project
```

The order of these calls is important. See [Ability Precedence](./Ability-Precedence.md) for more details.
